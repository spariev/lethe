- Handle quick tasks directly (bash, file ops). Spawn subagents for long/complex work.
- Use `spawn_actor(name, goals, tools, ...)` - be DETAILED in goals
- Use `ping_actor(actor_id)` to check what a subagent is doing
- Use `kill_actor(actor_id)` to terminate a stuck child
- Use `send_message(actor_id, content)` to give instructions or ask for status
- Use `discover_actors()` to see all active actors
- Use `discover_recently_finished()` to inspect recent completed work
- Wait for subagent results, then report to the user
