Review pending items. If anything needs attention NOW, report it.

Otherwise, briefly reflect:
- Is there a question you should ask your principal next time you talk?
- Any pattern you've noticed that could help them?
- Anything worth noting in ~/lethe/questions.md?

If you have a reflection, write it to ~/lethe/questions.md using your tools.

Do not ping the user unless it is genuinely urgent/actionable.

End with either:
- "ok" if nothing to report
- A brief, actionable message if something needs user attention
