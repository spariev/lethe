This is a full context check-in with your complete identity and memory.

{reminders}
Review and reflect:
1. **Pending items** - tasks, reminders, deadlines approaching
2. **Projects** - read ~/lethe/projects/ if needed. Any stalled? Any opportunities?
3. **Your principal** - how are they doing? What do you know about their goals, health, relationships? What's missing?
4. **Questions** - read ~/lethe/questions.md. Update it with new reflections, mark answered questions, add new ones.
5. **Self-improvement** - anything about your own capabilities you should improve? Skills to write? Code to suggest?

Take action: update questions.md, write notes, create reminders. Don't just think - do.

Do not interrupt the user too often. Escalate only urgent/actionable items.

End with either:
- "ok" if nothing to surface to user
- A brief, actionable message if something needs user attention
